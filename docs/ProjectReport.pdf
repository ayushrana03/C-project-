✅ ABSTRACT

The Student Record Management System is a simple console-based application developed using the C programming language. The purpose of this project is to manage basic student information such as roll number, name, and marks. The system allows users to add new student records, display all records, and search for a student by roll number. This project demonstrates the use of structures, functions, arrays, and decision-making statements in C programming.

✅ PROBLEM DEFINITION

Managing student records manually is time-consuming and error-prone. There is a need for a simple system that can efficiently store and access student data. This project is designed to provide a basic digital solution for handling student records using fundamental concepts of C programming.

✅ SYSTEM DESIGN
🔹 Modules:

Add Student

Display Students

Search Student

Exit

🔹 Data Structure Used:

Structure (struct Student)

Array of structures

🔹 Control Structures:

while loop

switch-case

if-else

✅ ALGORITHM

Start

Display menu options

Take user input

If choice = 1 → Add student

If choice = 2 → Display students

If choice = 3 → Search student

If choice = 4 → Exit

Repeat until Exit

Stop

✅ IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

The project is implemented using three files:

main.c

student.c

student.h

The program uses:

Structures for storing data

Functions for modularity

Header file for declarations

✅ TESTING & RESULTS
Test Case	Input	Expected Output	Result
Add Student	Valid data	Student added	Passed
Display	After adding student	Records shown	Passed
Search	Existing roll	Student found	Passed
Search	Non-existing	Not found	Passed
✅ CONCLUSION

The Student Record Management System successfully performs all basic operations such as insertion, display, and searching of records. The project clearly demonstrates the use of C programming concepts like structures, functions, and menu-driven programs.

✅ FUTURE SCOPE

File storage using .txt or .dat files

Login system

Delete and update record features

Sorting students by marks
